# Hyperlink Network & Community Detection on Reddit Subnetwork

**Project Overview**  
This project analyzes a 2,000-node Reddit text network to uncover community structures and thematic patterns. By combining advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) with graph-based techniques, the project demonstrates how unstructured text can be transformed into actionable insights through network analysis and machine learning.

**Key Objectives**
- Extract meaningful patterns and themes from a large Reddit hyperlink network.
- Identify community structures using graph-based algorithms.
- Compare and benchmark multiple analytical approaches for robustness.

**Techniques & Methods**
- **Community Detection:** Girvan–Newman algorithm to identify network communities.
- **Node Embeddings:** Node2Vec to capture structural and relational patterns in the network.
- **Graph Neural Networks:** GCN-enhanced embeddings for improved clustering.
- **Clustering & Benchmarking:** K-means clustering, evaluated with ARI, Silhouette Score, Calinski–Harabasz, and Davies–Bouldin Index for performance assessment.

**Tools & Technologies**
- Python (NetworkX, Node2Vec, PyTorch/GCN, scikit-learn, pandas)
- NLP methods for text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Data visualization for presenting network structures and community centers

**Project Workflow**
1. Collected and preprocessed Reddit text data to build the network.
2. Applied multiple community detection and embedding methods.
3. Benchmarked results using multiple validation metrics.
4. Visualized community centers and patterns to aid interpretability.
5. Documented methodology and insights with clear explanations of trade-offs.

**Outcome**
- Extracted thematic and structural patterns from the Reddit network.
- Demonstrated the integration of classical graph analytics and modern deep learning methods for text network analysis.
- Generated insights that can inform understanding of community dynamics in large online forums.
